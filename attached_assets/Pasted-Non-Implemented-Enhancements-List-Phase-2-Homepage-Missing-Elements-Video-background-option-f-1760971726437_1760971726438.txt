This comprehensive list shows that while the foundation and core structure have been implemented well, approximately 60-70% of the advanced features from the original luxury website transformation plan remain to be implemented. The current site has the basic luxury aesthetic and structure, but lacks many of the interactive features, additional pages, advanced animations, and comprehensive content that would bring it to the institutional-grade level of Prada, YSL, and Harrods websites.
